<h2>Answers to questions for Release 2</h2>

<h3>What is a Block level Element? What are some examples of block-level elements? What are they used for?</h3>

	<p>Block Level elements are the blocks of code that made up the HTML markup. They usually involve starting and ending in the same bracket. For example, this is a block-level element and you will only see this text as part of this block. Another block element is a Div, which will display and define all blocks within it.</p>

<h3>Can you find any good charts or resources on when you should use these elements? For example, when might you use a div versus a section?</h3>

	<p>You should use a div tag when you want to have a section or large group of tags together in one. It is also beneficial when you want to mark up this specific block with CSS. Source: <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_div.asp">W3 Schools</a> </p>

<h3>What is an inline element?</h3>

	<p>Inline elements are elements usually found within the text of a document. They enhance or modify the text of the HTML simple text. This includes moficiations like bold, italics, and underline. </p>

<h3>Do inline elements usually nest inside block-level elements, or is it typically the other way around?</h3>

	<p>Yes, usually inline elements will rest inside block-level elements. As they are marking up the text, and the text will usually sit in a block-levle element, it is usually one way where inline will be inside block level. There are some exceptions, but they will leave your code a little messy :) </p>
