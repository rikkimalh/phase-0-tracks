<h1>A guide to survive the next plot to destroy the Earth</h1>

<p>Hello there and welcome. By the time you have finished reading this story, <strong>you will be prepared and ready for the next plot to destroy planet Earth</strong>. Not to scare you, but as the frequency of invasions and plots to destroy the world have <em>quadrupled over the last six years</em>, you should be prepared with the knowledge and gear to survive and keep you and your families safe. </p>

	<h2>What you should do if your town is <strong>NOT</strong> invaded</h2>

		<ul>	
			<li>Stay updated with the news, or online.</li>

			<li>Don't call the police. They're hands are probably going to be full.</li>

			<li>For that matter, don't call the Avengers either. They'll get there when they get there...</li>

			<li>Stay away from the invaded city. Duh.</li>
		</ul>

	<h2>What you should do if your town is invaded</h2>

		<ol>
			<li>Stay in your homes, if you can. Don't go outside and don't be one of those storm chasers following a tornado. Seriously, those 	guys are crazy. Brave, but crazy.</li>
	
			<li>If you are outside, find shelter as far away from the destruction as possible, preferably a bomb shelter.</li>
	
			<li>Do not take the subways. You will likely get stuck down there with all the underground life.</li>
	
			<li>Lastly and this is important. I cannot stress this enough. <strong>Do. Not. Try. To. Be. A. Hero.</strong></li>
				<ul>
					<li>Don't travel to the invaded city, and put yourself in a position to put a hero in position to sacrafic themselves to save your life. Leave that to the super human professionals. Or the guy who made himself an indestructible suit of armor. Or the guy in the funny costume carrying around a hammer. Seriously you'd think one would do their research before plotting to destroy the Earth. Why not destroy Mars or Pluto first, like a practice run? Hope there's no mad titans reading this...</li>
				</ul>
		</ol>
