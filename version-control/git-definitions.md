# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
	1. Version control allows you to keep track of what features are being released, organizes your code, and tells you when specific items are pushed.
* What is a branch and why would you use one?
	1. A branch is a directory or folder that hosts your files. Usually, best practices call for having a master branch and a feature branch
	in order to allow for version control and tracking features in specific release numbers.
* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
	1. A commit allows you to push your files to staging for review. It is the step before going live with your code. Commit messages shoud be as detailed as possible, stating exactly what changes have been made in this version. 
* What is a merge conflict? 
	1. Merge conflict happens when a line of code that is changed happens to be missing in master, and git cannot recognize it. This can happen if two people changed the same lines of code or if someone deletes that line of code.
